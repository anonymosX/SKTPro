<h5>The tracking number for my order stopped updating, what happened?</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're buying from outside of the U.S. (particularly in Canada), your country's customs department may decide to hold your items at the border temporarily, often without explanation! Note: Canada's customs department takes a particularly long time to resolve these holds. This is relatively rare, but if your order is held up in customs, we suggest calling your country's customs department directly and ask that they release your items immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: if for some reason your order is never released by customs, we'll send you a replacement!</span></p>
